# Plagiarism-Detection

### Motivation:
This project started before CSI held its 21 Days of DSA Challenge. A common issue with small-scale or club-level coding challenges is the reliance on providing problem statements from the internet, whose solutions are readily available. Our goal was to eliminate this problem by selecting a few problem statements and scraping their entire solution codebase. This allowed us to run plagiarism checks on the entries we received through our own coding challenges. 

Plagiarism Detection operates on a straightforward mechanism: we receive submissions from students based on a given problem statement and then compare their solutions against those stored in our repository. Upon comparison, a 'Similarity Score' is generated, and if it exceeds a predefined threshold, we identify the submission as copied or exhibiting plagiarism.
